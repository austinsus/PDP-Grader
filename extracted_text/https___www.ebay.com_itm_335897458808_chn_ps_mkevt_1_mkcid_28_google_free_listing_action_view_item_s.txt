- m***l (264)- Feedback left by buyer.Past 6 monthsVerified purchaseShipping was extremely fast. I had no clue it was coming through Amazon. Amazon packaging and handling has never done us wrong. Knock on wood. It’s just as described. Value & price should have been aligned with that of Amazon, which was $4 cheaper than what I paid. I didn’t know I could have boiled it on Amazon for cheaper.
